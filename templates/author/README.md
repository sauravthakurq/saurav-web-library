# Author , Dark Editorial Blog & Publication Website Template Clone (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Keen Slider + Fuse.js)

[![Watch Demo](./poster.jpg)](./demo.mp4)

A pixel-faithful clone of the Lexington Themes "Author" premium Astro template, rebuilt as a self-contained, zero-build-step plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript project. Author is a dark, publication-style blog template for architecture writing, featuring a fixed navigation bar with a search modal, full-bleed hero imagery, a horizontal Keen Slider carousel for featured posts, a subscriber-only article grid, an individual authors section with profile pages, membership tiers, sign-in and sign-up forms, and a comprehensive design-system reference. All assets are vendored locally; no server or build tool is required.

## Run

```sh
# Option 1 , open directly in browser
open index.html

# Option 2 , serve with Python
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

No `npm install` or build step is needed. All dependencies (Inter font via rsms.me CDN, Keen Slider, Fuse.js) are either loaded from CDN or vendored in `assets/js/`.

## Pages
