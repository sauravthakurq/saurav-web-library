		q: "Why only three colours?",

	{
		q: "How is depth handled without gradients or blur?",
		a: "Every elevated surface uses a hard offset shadow — a solid black rectangle nudged 4 to 8 pixels down and right. It reads like cut paper layered on a workbench, honest and instantly legible.",
	},
	{
		q: "Is it accessible and responsive?",
		a: "Yes. Type scales from mobile to poster-scale desktop, focus rings are visible and offset, colour pairings hold contrast, and the whole page respects prefers-reduced-motion.",
